# QuadMollyRobot
Controlling Micropython code for my quadruped robot based on DRG's Molly. 

So far the two code files are a custom library for controlling the MG995 high torque servo and a small testing class, but once the mechanisms are finalized I'll begin writing motor sequencing code for a walking action.
